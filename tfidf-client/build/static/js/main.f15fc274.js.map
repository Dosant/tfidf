Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Карякин и Карлсен ровесники: оба родились в 1990 году, оба — вундеркинды современных шахмат, побившие не один рекорд. Карякин стал самым молодым гроссмейстером в мире в возрасте 12 лет и 211 дней, а Карлсен впервые возглавил мировой рейтинг ФИДЕ в 19 лет и не покидает первую строчку с июля 2011 года. И хотя оба шахматиста двигались к вершине одновременно и часто играли друг с другом на крупных турнирах, нельзя сказать, что они пришли к чемпионскому матчу похожими путями. Магнус Карлсен — суперзвезда, причем не только в шахматах. Успехи за доской он совмещает со съемками в рекламе, спонсорскими контрактами и собственным бизнесом. Так, компания Карлсена выпустила шахматное приложение Play Magnus, которое установили более 600 тысяч раз. Норвежец регулярно появляется на телевидении и чуть было не снялся в кино, когда в 2012 году Джей Джей Абрамс предложил ему эпизодическую роль в фильме «Стартрек: Возмездие». В 2013 году журнал Time включил Карлсена в список 100 самых влиятельных людей планеты, а осенью 2016 года вышел документальный фильм «Магнус», посвященный карьере шахматиста. Карлсен считается сильнейшим шахматистом современности. Он стал чемпионом мира в 2013 году, выиграв у Вишванатана Ананда, и защитил титул в матче против него год спустя. В 2014 Карлсен собрал шахматный «большой шлем», выиграв чемпионаты мира по быстрым шахматам и блицу. Одно из сильнейших качеств Карлсена — умение провоцировать соперника на ошибки. «Он понимает, что большинство игроков под давлением будут просчитываться даже в несложных позициях, поэтому никогда не ослабляет хватку. Понемногу просчеты копятся, и Карлсен превращает их в победу как будто по волшебству», — считает Паримарьян Неги, второй в списке самых молодых гроссмейстеров мира. Карлсен также отличается выдающимся видением позиции: там, где большинство игроков согласились бы на ничью, он всегда ищет путь к победе. И часто его находит. По мнению Неги, именно благодаря этому Карлсен — грозный соперник для лучших шахматистов, и противостоять его давлению могут единицы, в том числе Сергей Карякин.`\n            },\n            {\n                type: 'url',\n                src: 'https://meduza.io/feature/2016/11/11/demonstratsii-pererosli-v-besporyadki'\n            }],\n            tfidf: null,\n            isLoading: false\n        };\n    }\n\n    isValid() {\n        if (this.state.src.length === 0) {return false;}\n        const isValid = this.state.src.every((src) => {\n            if (src.type === 'url') {\n                return isUrl(src.src);\n            } else {\n                return !!src.src;\n            }\n        });\n        return isValid;\n    }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/App.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nconst TermsTable = ({terms, startIndex}) => {\n\n    return (\n        <table className=\"u-full-width\">\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>#</th>\n                    <th>Слово</th>\n                    <th>TF-IDF</th>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                {\n                    terms\n                        .map((term, idx) => {\n                            return (\n                                <tr key={idx}>\n                                    <td>{1 + startIndex + idx}</td>\n                                    <td>{term.term}</td>\n                                    <td>{term.tfidf.toFixed(2)}</td>\n                                </tr>\n                            );\n                        })\n                }\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n    );\n};\n\n\nclass ListTerms extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"row\">\n                <div>\n                    <TermsTable terms={this.props.listTerms.slice(0, 10)} startIndex={0}/>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ListTerms;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/Components/ListTerms.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\nimport './Spinner.css';\n\nconst Spinner = ({loading}) => {\n    console.log(loading);\n    if (!loading) {\n        return null;\n    } else {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"sk-circle\">\n                <div className=\"sk-circle1 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle2 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle3 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle4 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle5 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle6 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle7 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle8 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle9 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle10 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle11 sk-child\"></div>\n                <div className=\"sk-circle12 sk-child\"></div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n};\n\nexport default Spinner;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/Spinner/Spinner.js\n **/","// const server = 'http://localhost:8100';\nconst server = '';\n\nexport function tfidf(src) {\n    return fetch(server + '/tfidf', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n            'Accept': 'application/json',\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        },\n        body: JSON.stringify({src: src})\n    })\n    .then(checkStatus);\n}\n\nfunction checkStatus(response) {\n    if (response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300) {\n        return response.json();\n    } else {\n        return response.json()\n            .then((err) => {\n                return Promise.reject(err);\n            });\n    }\n}\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/api.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport 'skeleton-css/css/normalize.css';\nimport 'skeleton-css/css/skeleton.css';\nimport 'sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.css';\nimport './index.css';\nimport './tfidf.css';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <App />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/index.js\n **/","'use strict'\n\nexports.byteLength = byteLength\nexports.toByteArray = toByteArray\nexports.fromByteArray = fromByteArray\n\nvar lookup = []\nvar revLookup = []\nvar Arr = typeof Uint8Array !== 'undefined' ?
